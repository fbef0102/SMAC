# How to catch cheater
* Server would log informations in ```sourcemod/logs/smac.log``` if a player is suspicious.

# What is the difference
* Silenci0 no longer supports, and there are still few errors to fix, so here I come
* Don't get me wrong, I won't improve or add new anti-cheat feature, don't ask.
* Make it support L4D1/2 only, if you are looking for other games, go search other smac
